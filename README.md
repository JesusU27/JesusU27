# 👋 Hi, I'm Jesús Uribe (@JesusU27)

I'm a **Full Stack Developer** passionate about building scalable and modern applications from end to end. I work with a wide range of technologies, focusing on clean code, performance, and user experience.

---

## 🧰 Tech Stack

**Frontend**  
🟢 Vue.js 3 (Composition API, Option API, Vite, Routing)  
🟠 Angular (Material, Routing, Forms)  
🔵 React (Hooks, Routings, Material UI)

**Backend**
☕ Spring Boot (Java, REST APIs, JWT, JPA, Bcrypt, Lombok)  
🟣 .NET Core (C#, Entity Framework, NuGet, JWT)

**Mobile Applications**
⚡ Flutter:
I use Flutter to build fast and expressive apps for both Android and iOS from a single codebase. I follow clean architecture principles, manage state efficiently using Bloc, Provider and Riverpod.

🤖 Native Android (Java/Kotlin):
I have experience building native Android apps using modern Android development practices like Jetpack Compose, ViewModel, Room, and Retrofit.

**Others**  
🧩 GitHub Actions, Firebase, Swagger, Postman  
🗄️ PostgreSQL, MySQL, MSSQL, SQLite, MongoDB  

## 🛠️🧱 Software Architecture

I focus on designing maintainable and scalable systems, applying proven architectural patterns:

🧠 Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
Emphasizing the business logic with rich domain models and clearly separated concerns.

🧼 Clean Architecture
Centered around the domain, with a clear separation of concerns and strict boundaries between layers. Focused on independence from frameworks, UI, databases, and external tools.

🧩 Hexagonal Architecture (Ports & Adapters)
Making the core domain independent from external technologies like databases, UI, or frameworks.

🧱 Layered Architecture
Organizing code into logical layers (presentation, application, domain, infrastructure) for better separation of concerns and testability.

These approaches help me build systems that are testable, extensible, and resilient over time.
